### Assignment: mnist_ensemble
#### Date: Deadline: Mar 14, 7:59 a.m.
#### Points: 2 points
#### Examples: mnist_ensemble_examples
#### Tests: mnist_ensemble_tests

Your goal in this assignment is to implement model ensembling.
The [mnist_ensemble.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/03/mnist_ensemble.py)
template trains `args.models` individual models, and your goal is to perform
an ensemble of the first model, first two models, first three models, â€¦, all
models, and evaluate their accuracy on the test set.

_Note that your results may be slightly different, depending on your CPU type and whether you use a GPU._
- `python3 mnist_ensemble.py --models=5`
```
