### Assignment: tagger_competition
#### Date: Deadline: Apr 11, 7:59 a.m.
#### Points: 4 points+5 bonus

In this assignment, you should extend `tagger_cle`
into a real-world Czech part-of-speech tagger. We will use
Czech PDT dataset loadable using the [morpho_dataset.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/07/morpho_dataset.py)
module. Note that the dataset contains more than 1500 unique POS tags and that
the POS tags have a fixed structure of 15 positions (so it is possible to
generate the POS tag characters independently).

You can use the following additional data in this assignment:
- You can use outputs of a morphological analyzer loadable with
  [morpho_analyzer.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/07/morpho_analyzer.py).
  If a word form in train, dev or test PDT data is known to the analyzer,
  all its _(lemma, POS tag)_ pairs are returned.
- You can use any _unannotated_ text data (Wikipedia, Czech National Corpus, â€¦),
  and also any pre-trained word embeddings (assuming they were trained on plain
  texts).

The task is a [_competition_](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/courses/npfl114/2122-summer#competitions).
Everyone who submits a solution with at least 92.5% label accuracy gets
4 points; the rest 5 points will be distributed depending on relative ordering
of your solutions. Lastly, **3 bonus points** will be given to anyone surpassing
pre-neural-network state-of-the-art of **96.35%**.

You can start with the
[tagger_competition.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/07/tagger_competition.py)
template, which among others generates test set annotations in the required format. Note that
you can evaluate the predictions as usual using the [morpho_dataset.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/07/morpho_dataset.py)
module, either by running with `--task=tagger --evaluate=path` arguments, or using its
`evaluate_file` method.
