### Assignment: cags_segmentation
#### Date: Deadline: Mar 28, 7:59
#### Points: 4 points+5 bonus

The goal of this assignment is to use pretrained EfficientNet-B0 model to
achieve best image segmentation IoU score on the CAGS dataset.
The dataset and the EfficientNet-B0 is described in the `cags_classification`
assignment.

A mask is evaluated using _intersection over union_ (IoU) metric, which is the
intersection of the gold and predicted mask divided by their union, and the
whole test set score is the average of its masks' IoU. A TensorFlow compatible
metric is implemented by the class `MaskIoUMetric` of the
[cags_dataset.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/05/cags_dataset.py)
module, which can also evaluate your predictions (either by running with
`--task=segmentation --evaluate=path` arguments, or using its
`evaluate_segmentation_file` method).

The task is a [_competition_](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/courses/npfl114/2122-summer#competitions). Everyone who submits a solution
which achieves at least _87%_ test set IoU gets 4 points; the rest
5 points will be distributed depending on relative ordering of your solutions.

You may want to start with the
[cags_segmentation.py](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/05/cags_segmentation.py)
template, which generates the test set annotation in the required format â€“
each mask should be encoded on a single line as a space separated sequence of
integers indicating the length of alternating runs of zeros and ones.
