### Assignment: crac2022
#### Date: Deadline: Evaluation Jun 1-8

If you would like to try participating in a real shared task,
right now [CRAC 2022 Shared Task on Multilingual Coreference Resolution](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/corefud/crac22)
is running, with the evaluation phase in Jun 1-8.

The goal is to perform coreference resolution on 13 datasets in 10 languages,
where coreference resolution is the task of clustering together multiple
mentions of the same entity appearing in a textual document (e.g., `Joe Biden`,
`the U.S. President`, and `he`).

Note that you should then also write a system description paper â€“ however, it
might be possible to send a joint paper, so you would only need to write
several paragraphs about your approach.
