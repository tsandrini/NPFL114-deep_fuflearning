# Course Requirements

## Practicals
~~~

- There will be 2-3 assignments a week, each with a 2-week deadline.
~~~
  - There is also another week-long second deadline, but for less points.
~~~
- After solving the assignment, you get non-bonus points, and sometimes also
  bonus points.
~~~
- To pass the practicals, you need to get 80 non-bonus points. There will be
  assignments for at least 120 non-bonus points.
~~~
- If you get more than 80 points (be it bonus or non-bonus), they will be
  all transferred to the exam. Additionally, if you solve all the assignments,
  you pass the exam with grade 1.

~~~
## Lecture

You need to pass a written exam (or solve all the assignments).
~~~
- All questions are publicly listed on the course website.
~~~

section: Notation
# Notation

- $a$, $→a$, $⇉A$, $⇶A$: scalar (integer or real), vector, matrix, tensor

~~~
  - all vectors are always **column** vectors
~~~
  - transposition changes a column vector into a row vector, so $→a^T$ is a row vector
~~~
  - we denote **scalar product** between vectors $→a$ and $→b$ as $→a^T →b$
    - we understand it as matrix multiplication
~~~

- $⁇a$, $⁇→a$, $⁇⇉A$: scalar, vector, matrix random variable

~~~
- $\frac{df}{dx}$: derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$

- $\frac{∂f}{∂x}$: partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$

~~~
- $∇_{→x} f(→x)$: gradient of $f$ with respect to $→x$, i.e.,
  $\left(\frac{∂f(→x)}{∂x_1}, \frac{∂f(→x)}{∂x_2}, \ldots, \frac{∂f(→x)}{∂x_n}\right)$

---
section: Random Variables
# Random Variables
A random variable $⁇x$ is a result of a random process. It can be discrete or
continuous.

~~~
## Probability Distribution
A probability distribution describes how likely are individual values a random
variable can take.

The notation $⁇x ∼ P$ stands for a random variable $⁇x$ having a distribution $P$.

~~~
For discrete variables, the probability that $⁇x$ takes a value $x$ is denoted as
$P(x)$ or explicitly as $P(⁇x = x)$. All probabilities are non-negative and sum
of probabilities of all possible values of $⁇x$ is $∑_x P(⁇x=x) = 1$.

~~~
For continuous variables, the probability that the value of $⁇x$ lies in the interval
$[a, b]$ is given by $∫_a^b p(x)\d x$, where $p(x)$ is the _probability density
function_, which is always non-negative and integrates to 1 over the range of
all values of $⁇x$.

# Joint, Conditional, Marginal Probability

![w=44%,f=right](joint_probability.svgz)

For two random variables, **joint probability distribution** is a distribution
of all possible pairs of outputs (and analogously for more than two):

$$P(⁇x = x_2, ⁇y = y_1).$$

~~~
**Marginal distribution** is a distribution of one (or a subset) of the random
variables and can be obtained by summing over the other variable(s):
$$P(⁇x=x_2) = {\small ∑\nolimits}_y P(⁇x = x_2, ⁇y = y).$$

~~~
**Conditional distribution** is a distribution of one (or a subset) of the
random variables, given that another event has already occurred:
$$P(⁇x=x_2 | ⁇y=y_1) = P(⁇x = x_2, ⁇y = y_1) / P(⁇y = y_1).$$

~~~
If $P(⁇x, ⁇y) = P(⁇x) ⋅ P(⁇y)$ or $P(⁇x | ⁇y) = P(⁇x)$, random variables $⁇x$ and $⁇y$ are **independent**.

---
# Random Variables

## Expectation
The expectation of a function $f(x)$ with respect to discrete probability
distribution $P(x)$ is defined as:
$$𝔼_{⁇x ∼ P}[f(x)] ≝ ∑_x P(x)f(x).$$

For continuous variables it is computed as:
$$𝔼_{⁇x ∼ p}[f(x)] ≝ ∫_x p(x)f(x)\d x.$$

~~~
If the random variable is obvious from context, we can write only $𝔼_P[x]$
or even $𝔼[x]$.

~~~
Expectation is linear, i.e.,
$$𝔼_⁇x [αf(x) + βg(x)] = α𝔼_⁇x [f(x)] + β𝔼_⁇x [g(x)].$$

---
# Random Variables

## Variance
Variance measures how much the values of a random variable differ from its
mean $μ = 𝔼[x]$.

$$\begin{aligned}
  \Var(x) &≝ 𝔼\left[\big(x - 𝔼[x]\big)^2\right]\textrm{, or more generally,} \\
  \Var(f(x)) &≝ 𝔼\left[\big(f(x) - 𝔼[f(x)]\big)^2\right].
\end{aligned}$$

~~~
It is easy to see that
$$\Var(x) = 𝔼\left[x^2 - 2x𝔼[x] + \big(𝔼[x]\big)^2\right] = 𝔼\left[x^2\right] - \big(𝔼[x]\big)^2,$$
because $𝔼\big[2x𝔼[x]\big] = 2(𝔼[x])^2$.

~~~
Variance is connected to $𝔼[x^2]$, the **second moment** of a random
variable – it is in fact a **centered** second moment.

---
# Common Probability Distributions
## Bernoulli Distribution
The Bernoulli distribution is a distribution over a binary random variable.
It has a single parameter $φ ∈ [0, 1]$, which specifies the probability of the random
variable being equal to 1.

~~~
$$\begin{aligned}
  P(x) &= φ^x (1-φ)^{1-x} \\
  𝔼[x] &= φ \\
  \Var(x) &= φ(1-φ)
\end{aligned}$$

![w=60%,h=center](bernoulli_variance.svgz)

---
# Common Probability Distributions
## Categorical Distribution
Extension of the Bernoulli distribution to random variables taking one of $K$ different
discrete outcomes. It is parametrized by $→p ∈ [0, 1]^K$ such that $∑_{i=0}^{K-1} p_{i} = 1$.

~~~
We represent outcomes as vectors $∈ \{0, 1\}^K$ in the **one-hot encoding**.
Therefore, an outcome $x ∈ \{0, 1, …, K-1\}$ is represented as a vector
$$→1_x ≝ \big([i = x]\big)_{i=0}^{K-1} = \big(\underbrace{0, …, 0}_{k}, 1, \underbrace{0, …, 0}_{K-k-1}\big).$$

~~~
The outcome probability, mean and variance are very similar to the Bernoulli
distribution.
$$\begin{aligned}
  P(→x) &= ∏\nolimits_{i=0}^{K-1} p_i^{x_i} \\
  𝔼[x_i] &= p_i \\
  \Var(x_i) &= p_i(1-p_i) \\
\end{aligned}$$

section: Information Theory
# Information Theory

## Self Information

Amount of **surprise** when a random variable is sampled.
~~~
- Should be zero for events with probability 1.
~~~
- Less likely events are more surprising.
~~~
- Independent events should have **additive** information.

~~~
$$I(x) ≝ -\log P(x) = \log \frac{1}{P(x)}$$

---
# Information Theory

## Entropy

Amount of **surprise** in the whole distribution.
$$H(P) ≝ 𝔼_{⁇x∼P}[I(x)] = -𝔼_{⁇x∼P}[\log P(x)]$$

~~~
- for discrete $P$: $H(P) = -∑_x P(x) \log P(x)$
- for continuous $P$: $H(P) = -∫ P(x) \log P(x)\,\mathrm dx$

~~~
Because $\lim_{x → 0} x \log x = 0$, for $P(x) = 0$ we consider\
$P(x) \log P(x)$ to be zero.

~~~ ~~~
![w=40%,f=right](entropy_example.svgz)

- for discrete $P$: $H(P) = -∑_x P(x) \log P(x)$
- for continuous $P$: $H(P) = -∫ P(x) \log P(x)\,\mathrm dx$

Because $\lim_{x → 0} x \log x = 0$, for $P(x) = 0$ we consider
$P(x) \log P(x)$ to be zero.

~~~
Note that in the continuous case, the continuous entropy (also called
_differential entropy_) has slightly different semantics, for example, it can be
negative.

~~~
From now on, all logarithms are _natural logarithms_ with base $e$.

---
# Information Theory

## Cross-Entropy

$$H(P, Q) ≝ -𝔼_{⁇x∼P}[\log Q(x)]$$

~~~
**Gibbs inequality** states that
- $H(P, Q) ≥ H(P)$
- $H(P) = H(P, Q) ⇔ P = Q$
~~~
- Proof: Using the fact that $\log x ≤ (x-1)$ with equality only for $x=1$, we get
  $$∑_x P(x) \log \frac{Q(x)}{P(x)} ≤ ∑_x P(x) \left(\frac{Q(x)}{P(x)}-1\right) = ∑_x Q(x) - ∑_x P(x) = 0.$$
~~~
- Corollary: For a categorical distribution with $n$ outcomes, $H(P) ≤ \log n$,
  because for $Q(x) = 1/n$ we get $H(P) ≤ H(P, Q) = -∑_x P(x) \log Q(x) = \log n.$
~~~

Note that generally $H(P, Q) ≠ H(Q, P)$.

---
# Information Theory

## Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL Divergence)

Sometimes also called **relative entropy**.

$$D_\textrm{KL}(P \| Q) ≝ H(P, Q) - H(P) = 𝔼_{⁇x∼P}[\log P(x) - \log Q(x)]$$

~~~
- consequence of Gibbs inequality: $D_\textrm{KL}(P \| Q) ≥ 0$, $D_\textrm{KL}(P \| Q) = 0$ iff $P = Q$
~~~
- generally $D_\textrm{KL}(P \| Q) ≠ D_\textrm{KL}(Q \| P)$

---
# Nonsymmetry of KL Divergence

![w=100%,v=middle](kl_nonsymmetry.svgz)

---
# Common Probability Distributions
## Normal (or Gaussian) Distribution
Distribution over real numbers, parametrized by a mean $μ$ and variance $σ^2$:
$$𝓝(x; μ, σ^2) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2πσ^2}} \exp \left(-\frac{(x - μ)^2}{2σ^2}\right)$$

~~~
For standard values $μ=0$ and $σ^2=1$ we get $𝓝(x; 0, 1) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2π}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}$.

![w=45%,h=center](normal_distribution.svgz)

---
# Why Normal Distribution

## Central Limit Theorem
The sum of independent identically distributed random variables
with finite variance converges to normal distribution.

~~~
## Principle of Maximum Entropy
Given a set of constraints, a distribution with maximal entropy fulfilling the
constraints can be considered the most general one, containing as little
additional assumptions as possible.

~~~
Considering distributions on all real numbers with a given mean and variance, it
can be proven (using variational inference) that such a distribution with
**maximum entropy** is exactly the normal distribution.

# Machine Learning

A possible definition of learning from Mitchell (1997):
>  A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some
>  class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in
>  T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

~~~
- Task T
    - _classification_: assigning one of $k$ categories to a given input
    - _regression_: producing a number $x∈ℝ$ for a given input
    - _structured prediction_, _denoising_, _density estimation_, …
~~~
- Measure P
    - _accuracy_, _error rate_, _F-score_, …
~~~
- Experience E
    - _supervised_: usually a dataset with desired outcomes (_labels_ or
      _targets_)
    - _unsupervised_: usually data without any annotation (raw text, raw images, …)
    - _reinforcement learning_, _semi-supervised learning_, …

# Neural Network Architecture

There is a weight on each edge, and an activation function $f$ is performed on the
hidden layers, and optionally also on the output layer.
$$h_i = f\left(∑_j w_{i,j} x_j + b_i\right)$$

~~~
If the network is composed of layers, we can use matrix notation and write
$$→h = f\left(⇉W →x + →b\right),$$
where $⇉W ∈ ℝ^{|\mathit{hidden~neurons}|×|\mathit{input~neurons}|}$ is a matrix
of weights and $→b ∈ ℝ^{|\mathit{hidden~neurons}|}$ is a vector of biases.

---
# Neural Network Activation Functions
## Output Layers
- none (linear regression if there are no hidden layers)

~~~
- $σ$ (sigmoid; logistic regression if there are no hidden layers)
  $$σ(x) ≝ \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$$
  is used to model a probability $p$ of a binary event; its input is called
  a **logit**, $\log \frac{p}{1-p}$

~~~
- $\softmax$ (maximum entropy model if there are no hidden layers)
  $$\begin{gathered}
    \softmax(→x) ∝ e^{→x} \\
    \softmax(→x)_i ≝ \frac{e^{x_i}}{∑_j e^{x_j}}
  \end{gathered}$$
  is used to model probability distribution $→p$; its input is called
  a **logit**, $\log(→p) + c$

---
# Neural Network Activation Functions
## Hidden Layers
- none: does not help, composition of linear mapping is a linear mapping

~~~
- $σ$: however, it works badly – nonsymmetrical, repeated application converges to
  the fixed point $x = σ(x) ≈ 0.659$, and $\frac{dσ}{dx}(0) = 1/4$

~~~
- $\tanh$
    - result of making $σ$ symmetrical and making the derivative in zero 1

# Universal Approximation Theorem '89

Let $φ(x):ℝ → ℝ$ be a nonconstant, bounded and nondecreasing continuous function. \
(Later a proof was given also for $φ = \ReLU$ and even for any nonpolynomial
function.)

For any $ε > 0$ and any continuous function $f: [0, 1]^D → ℝ$, there exists
$H ∈ ℕ$, $→v ∈ ℝ^H$, $→b ∈ ℝ^H$ and $⇉W ∈ ℝ^{D×H}$, such that if we denote
$$F(→x) = →v^T φ(→x^T ⇉W + →b) = ∑_{i=1}^H v_i φ(→x^T →{W_{*, i}} + b_i),$$
where $φ$ is applied elementwise,
~~~
then for all $→x ∈ [0, 1]^D$:
$$|F(→x) - f(→x)| < ε.$$

---
# Universal Approximation Theorem for ReLUs

Sketch of the proof:

~~~
- If a function is continuous on a closed interval, it can be approximated by
  a sequence of lines to arbitrary precision.

![w=35%,h=center](relu_approx.svg)

~~~
- However, we can create a sequence of $k$ linear segments as a sum of $k$ ReLU
  units – on every endpoint a new ReLU starts (i.e., the input ReLU value is
  zero at the endpoint), with a tangent which is the difference between the
  target tangent and the tangent of the approximation until this point.

# Universal Approximation Theorem for Squashes

Sketch of the proof for a squashing function $φ(x)$ (i.e., nonconstant, bounded and

~~~
- We can prove $φ$ can be arbitrarily close to a hard threshold by compressing
  it horizontally.

![w=38%,h=center](universal_approximation_squash.png)

  segments
